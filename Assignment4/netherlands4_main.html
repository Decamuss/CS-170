<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Geographical Data</h2>


<div>The Netherlands is a very flat country with almost 25% of its land at, or below sea level. The country covers a total area of 41,865 sq. km. Low rolling hills 
cover some of the central areas, and in the far south, the land rises into the foothills of the Ardennes Mountains. Vaalserberg, the country's highest point is located there, rising to 322 m (1,053 ft).
<P>The Netherlands is crossed by hundreds of miles of navigable canals. One of the most important is the North Sea Canal, as it enables ocean-going ships to reach 
the port of Amsterdam. Water, water everywhere, as the central and southern Netherlands are positioned at the delta of four major rivers, including 
the Rijn, Mass, Scheldt and Waal.</div>
