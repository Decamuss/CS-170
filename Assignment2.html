    <h1>The Netherlands</h1>
    <h2>Geographical Data</h2>
    <p>The Netherlands is a very flat country with almost 25% of its land at, or below sea level. The country covers a <br>
        total area of 41,865 sq. km. Low rolling hills cover some of the central areas, and in the far south, the land rises <br>
        into the foothills of the Ardennes Mountains. Vaalserberg, the country's highest point is located there, rising to <br>
        322 m (1,053 ft).</p>
        <p>The Netherlands is crossed by hundreds of miles of navigable canals. One of the most important is the North Sea <br>
            Canal, as it enables ocean-going ships to reach the port of Amsterdam. Water, water everywhere, as the central <br>
            and southern Netherlands are positioned at the delta of four major rivers, including the Rijn, Mass, Scheldt and <br>
            Waal.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>

    <p>The Netherlands has been a <b>constitutional monarchy</b> since 1815, and due to the efforts of Johan Rudolph <br>
        Thorbecke became a parliamentary democracy in 1848. The Netherlands is described as a consociational state. <br>
        Dutch politics and governance are characterised by an effort to achieve broad consensus on important issues, <br>
        within both the political community and society as a whole.</p>
    <p>In 2017, The Economist ranked the Netherlands as the 11th most democratic country in the world. The monarch <br>
        is the head of state, at present <b>King Willem-Alexander</b> of the Netherlands. Constitutionally, the position is <br>
        equipped with limited powers. By law, the King has the right to be periodically briefed and consulted on <br>
        government affairs.</p>
